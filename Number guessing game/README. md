# Second Project: 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A tiny little project I made for fun — guess a number between 1 and 10 and see if you can beat the game 😏.  
It keeps score, gives hints if your guess is too high or too low, and lets you keep playing as long as you want.  

This is the second week of my Python practice, where I make little projects to improve.  
I made this number guessing game with a scoring system at 3 AM after a full day of studying, and somehow managed to pull it off like the queen I am 🤟🏻😫.  
It's very simple Python code, but practice is practice!
