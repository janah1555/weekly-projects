# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A small fun project I made — try to guess the number the computer picked between 1 and 10 😏.  
It tracks your score, gives hints if your guess is too high or too low, and lets you keep playing as long as you want.  

This is the second week of my Python practice, where I make little projects to improve.  
I created this number guessing game with a scoring system at 3 AM after a full day of studying, and somehow managed to pull it off like the queen I am 🤟🏻😫.  
It's very simple Python code, but practice is practice!  

Quick, easy, and a neat way to play with Python, randomness, and loops.
